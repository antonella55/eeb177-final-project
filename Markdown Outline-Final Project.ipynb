    "The *Alligatoridae* family is made up of species classified as alligators and caimans. *Alligatoridae* belongs to the order Crocodilia which is a sister taxa to birds(aves) and turtles(Testudines) due to the presence of the amniotic sac(2). All members of the *Alligatoridae* are carnivorous. Today the *Alligatoridae* family is distributed in Central and South America as well as the Southeastern United States (1). Their distinguished features such as massive skull and short, broad snout have not change significantly since the late Triassic. Members of *Alligatoridea* do not tolerate salt water, therefore their main way of dispersal was via land bridges. There is evidence that within *Alligatoridea* the caiman subclass evolved from the alligator subclass after its dispersal southward from North America to South America. \n",
